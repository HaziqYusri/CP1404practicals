## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

My knowledge on key principles has improved my ability to utilise functions and refactor them to be efficient.

I still need brushing up on certain language usage and naming conventions of which i am not used to.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

My tests and practicals are decent but need more perfecting especially for practical work.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Punctuality and more insightful clarifications in class.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I hope there is a loosening on the strict formatting and naming principles expected in assessments. I also hope there
are more chances for collaborative work as that would be realistic of work in the industry.
